      <I>The Corpus of Middle English</I> is a full text collection produced
      and maintained by the University of Michigan Humanities Text Initiative.
      It has its own separate help database that it shares with other HTI collections.
      This can be accessed through the help links that are in place in the navigation
      bars in the Corpus. (Please note that this help database is under development;
      if the help links are not in place at this time, they will be shortly.)
      <BR><!-- This stencil is hyperlinked to
      the HyperBibliography entry for that work. Once you have entered
      the HyperBibliography, you can either use the back button on your
      browser to return to the entry in the MED or you can use the
      links in the navigational bar to move you to the main Hyperbibliography page where you may carry out further searches.  -->
