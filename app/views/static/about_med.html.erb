      <H3><A NAME="ov"></A>About the Middle English Compendium</H3>

      <p><em>The Middle English Compendium</em> has been designed to
      offer easy access to and interconnectivity between three major
      Middle English electronic resources: an electronic version of the
      Middle English Dictionary, a HyperBibliography of Middle English
      prose and verse based on the MED bibliographies, a Corpus of Middle
      English Prose and Verse, as well as links to an
      associated network of electronic resources. Hypertext links offer quick
      connections between, e.g., an MED citation, bibliographical
      information about its source, and an electronic version of the
      source, if one is included in the collection (we
      hope eventually to have electronic versions of all the source texts).</p>

      <H3><A NAME="med"></A>About The Electronic Middle English Dictionary </H3>

      <P>The print <EM>Middle English Dictionary</EM>, now complete,
      has been described as &quot;the greatest achievement
      in medieval scholarship in America.&quot; Its 15,000
      pages offer a comprehensive analysis of lexicon and usage for
      the period 1100-1500, based on the analysis of a collection of
      over three million citation slips, the largest collection of this
      kind available. This electronic version of the MED preserves all
      the details of the print MED, but goes far beyond this, by
      converting its contents into an enormous database, searchable in
      ways impossible within any print dictionary.</P>


      <H3><A NAME="hyp"></A>About The HyperBibliography of Middle English</H3>

      <P>The <EM>HyperBibliography of Middle English</EM> includes all
      the Middle English materials which are cited in the Middle
      English Dictionary. Although this bibliography is not exhaustive,
      it offers what we believe to be the most comprehensive single
      list of these materials available. Titles have been adopted from
      <EM>A Manual of the Writings in Middle English</EM> whenever possible, and
      are followed by the MED stencil (short title) in brackets. Once
      you retrieve a list of works or authors or manuscripts by
      browsing or searching, click on any item to move to a page of
      information about manuscripts, editions, bibliographical
      references, and MED title stencils. </P>


      <H3><A NAME="corp"></A>Corpus of Middle English Prose and Verse</H3>

      <P>The Humanities Text Initiative intends to develop the <EM>Corpus
      of Middle English Prose and Verse </EM>into an extensive and
      reliable collection of Middle English electronic texts, either by
      converting the texts ourselves or by negotiating access to other
      collections produced to specified high standards of accuracy. At
      present, sixty-two texts are available; about eighty others will be
      added soon, with another 150 smaller texts in preparation.
      HTI would like to include in the corpus all editions of
      Middle English texts used in the MED, and the more recent
      scholarly editions which in some cases may have superseded them.
      The Corpus is provided with a full array of search mechanisms,
      and texts may be searched individually, in user designated
      groups, or collectively.</P>
