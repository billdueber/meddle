# Where are the notes?

```sh
"MED/ENTRYFREE/SUPPLEMENT/EG/NOTE",
"MED/ENTRYFREE/NOTE",
"MED/ENTRYFREE/SUPPLEMENT/NOTE",
"MED/ENTRYFREE/SUPPLEMENT/EG/CIT/NOTE"
```

So, notes appear inside an `ENTRYFREE`, an `EG`, a `CIT`, and a `SUPPLEMENT`.
We should probably look for them everywhere :-(

# What do the supplements look like?

Only looking at top-level-ish tags, we only get a few forms.

```
SUPPLEMENT
SUPPLEMENT/EG/CIT/BIBL
SUPPLEMENT/EG/CIT/NOTE
SUPPLEMENT/EG/CIT/Q
SUPPLEMENT/EG/NOTE
SUPPLEMENT/NOTE
```
